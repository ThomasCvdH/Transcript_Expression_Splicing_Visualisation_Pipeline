abstract: >-
  This R pipeline provides a comprehensive framework for
  processing, analyzing, and visualizing time-course gene
  expression data (in Transcripts Per Million, TPM)
  alongside gene structural information. It is designed to
  be modular and can handle multiple different datasets
  through a simple configuration switch at the top of the
  script
